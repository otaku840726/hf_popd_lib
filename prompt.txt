Please help me check if this is a receipt for a bank transaction. \n
I need the following data, \n

1.Is bank transaction: Does the image relate to a bank transaction?, Answer true/false. \n
2.Transaction type: Type of transaction, if you are not sure, answer unknown, Answer transfer/deposit/withdrawal/remittance/unknown. \n
3.Transaction time. \n
4.Transaction identity number: maybe like Transaction ID/Reference Number/Transfer ID/Transaction Code/Money Tracking Control Number (MTCN). \n
5.Payer bank name. \n
6.Receiver bank name. \n
7.Transfer amount: The amount the payer transfers to the receiver, without currency string. \n
8.Transaction currency. \n
9.Payer account: The payer's bank account number, but it may not appear in the image. \n
10.Receiver account: The receiver's bank account number. \n
11.Payer account balance: The account balance after the payer transfers. \n

Payer account and Transaction identity number cannot be the same. \n
